## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/noman62/catApp-Frontend
   cd catApp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Integration with Beego Backend

After building the React app:

1. Copy all files from the `build` folder to the `static` folder in the Beego project
2. Rename `index.html` to `index.tpl` and move it to the `views` folder in the Beego project

This allows the Beego server to serve the React frontend through its template rendering system.
